I was looking to see what version of macOS was available on github actions.

Currently the latest looks to be [macOS-12](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-13-github-actions-macos-12-for-github-hosted-runners-is-now-generally-available/) by default.  But going through this I stumbled upon [this PR](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/813), which was good, but lead me to this:

https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247

Wow, I didn't know that this even existed.  Nice to see github eating it's own dogfood.
