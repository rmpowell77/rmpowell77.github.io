title: My First Post!
---

At C++Now 2018 I was chatting with folks about how to construct a blog, and I was pointed to ["Jekyll Now"](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), a way to set up a blogging platform with github.  It looks both fun and easy to use!

My goal with this blog is to both collect and post ideas that I have, as well as improving my communication and writing skills.  I'm excited to see how it goes!
