title: Re-learning Github Pages
---

I’m back trying to blogging again.  I realized I've forgotten everything about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).   

I've set up my Github Pages using Barry Clark's [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) source.

I spent about an hour re-reading it and then I was able to get myself off the ground again!

I cloned out my Githup Pages to my local machine, and got things running locally to check out this post.

```
➜  rmpowell77 pwd
/Users/richardpowell/Development/github.com/rmpowell77
➜  rmpowell77 git clone git@github.com:rmpowell77/rmpowell77.github.io.git rmpowell77.github.io.git
➜  rmpowell77 pushd rmpowell77.github.io.git
➜  rmpowell77.github.io.git git:(master) ✗ gem install github-pages --user
➜  rmpowell77.github.io.git git:(master) ✗ jekyll serve
```



Some other resources that I thought were pretty good were: 

	https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html
	https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll


Now I'm set up to do the next couple of posts.  Going to be checking out a lot of CMake in the next month.
